## Shams Tex Mobile App (`artifacts/shamstex`)

Expo React Native app for Shams Tex fabric company.

### Features
- Luxury black + gold design
- **Multi-language support (AR/EN)**: `lib/i18n.ts` provides `useTranslation()` hook; language toggle in profile; persisted via AsyncStorage; RTL-aware with `isRTL`, `textAlign`, `flexDir` helpers
- OTP phone login with user roles (customer, merchant, employee, admin)
- Product catalog with fabric listings, colors, retail/wholesale pricing
- Cart with weight-based and piece-based ordering, payment method selection (cash, bank transfer, e-wallet, InstaPay)
- Order management with status tracking (pending → received → preparing → ready → delivered)
- Return/refund system: 3-stage flow (pending → returned → settled) with visual progress tracker; returns can be cancelled by admin or supervisor (with `cancel_returns` permission); customers can delete their own pending returns; cancelled returns allow re-submitting; returns appear as "استرجاع" filter in orders tab with cancelled state display
- Order editing: `edited: boolean` and `editedAt?: string` fields; shows yellow "معدّل" badge on OrderCard and order detail for staff
- Payment system: 4 methods (cash/bank transfer/e-wallet/InstaPay); e-wallet adds configurable fee %; modal shows payment details with copy-to-clipboard; admin configures payment numbers/accounts in settings
- Admin panel: products, prices, users, notifications, tabs management, payment settings
- Admin user management: delete customers/staff, promote to admin, primary admin (0000000001) protected from editing/deletion
- Push notifications system
- About/contact pages

### User Roles
- **Customer**: sees retail prices, can order
- **Merchant**: sees wholesale prices (approved by admin)
- **Employee**: limited admin access, permissions from admin
- **Supervisor**: broader admin access, can manage staff
- **Admin**: full control

### Permissions System
- Employee/Supervisor permissions stored in Firestore `customers` collection
- Permissions: `view_orders`, `edit_orders`, `view_products`, `edit_products`, `view_users`, `send_notifications`, `manage_staff`, `approve_upgrades`, `delete_orders`, `cancel_returns`, `manage_settings`
- Admin screens guarded by `useAdminGuard(permission)` hook — unauthorized access redirects back
- Permission changes sync in real-time to logged-in staff sessions

### Session Management
- Single-device enforcement: login from new device invalidates previous session via Firestore `sessions` collection
- Session token checked on app startup — mismatched token triggers auto-logout

### Order Editing by Customer
- Staff can mark an order as "editable" when an item is unavailable (button in order detail)
- Customer sees a yellow banner and "تعديل الطلب" button; opens cart pre-filled with order items
- Cart in edit mode shows "تصفح المنتجات لإضافة بديل" button to browse products
- On submit, `updateOrderItems` updates the order and clears editable flag
- Customer cannot edit orders otherwise
- Merchants see "اتصل بالجملة والتجار" call button in cart for piece orders

### Staff Order Locking
- When a staff member receives an order, `assignedTo` and `assignedToName` are set
- Other staff (except admin) cannot advance the order (buttons hidden, lock message shown)
- "استلمه: [name]" card displayed for all staff in order detail

### Real-time Sync
- Firestore listeners for: orders, customers, notifications, products
- Product order changes by admin reflect instantly for all users
- Permission/role changes sync to active sessions automatically
- `saveOrder` strips `undefined` values before Firestore write to avoid silent failures

### Demo accounts
- `0000000001` → Admin
- `0000000002` → Merchant  
- `0000000003` → Employee (default: view_orders, view_products)
- `0000000004` → Supervisor (default: view_orders, edit_orders, view_products, view_users, send_notifications, approve_upgrades)
- Any other number → Customer

### Key Files
- `app/_layout.tsx` — root layout with providers and splash screen
- `app/(tabs)/` — main tab screens (home, products, orders, contact)
- `app/product/[id].tsx` — product detail with color selection
- `app/cart.tsx` — shopping cart with try-catch checkout
- `app/order/[id].tsx` — order detail with status tracking
- `app/admin/` — admin management screens (all guarded by useAdminGuard)
- `context/AppContext.tsx` — global state with AsyncStorage persistence + Firestore listeners
- `hooks/useAdminGuard.ts` — permission guard hook for admin screens
- `hooks/useColors.ts` — design token hook
- `lib/firebase.ts` — Firestore operations + real-time subscriptions
- `lib/pushService.ts` — Expo push notifications
- `constants/colors.ts` — black/gold luxury design tokens

### Working Hours
- `WorkingDay` interface: `{ day, enabled, from, to }` stored in `settings.workingHours`
- Default: Sat–Thu 9:00–17:00 (Thu until 14:00), Friday off
- Admin can edit working hours in admin settings (toggle days, set from/to times)
- Orders cannot be moved from "pending" to "received" outside working hours (enforced in `updateOrderStatus`)

### Minimum Order Validation
- Weight orders: minimum 20 kg per item
- Piece orders: minimum 50 pieces per item
- Enforced at checkout with inline warnings in cart UI

### Notification Filtering
- `filterNotificationsForUser` (lib/notificationFilter.ts) controls visibility per role
- Untargeted notifications (no targetRole, no targetUserId) show to ALL roles
- Customer/merchant see: their own targeted + their role-targeted + untargeted ("all")
- Employee sees: own targeted + employee/staff targeted + untargeted
- Supervisor sees: own targeted + supervisor/staff + upgrade requests + untargeted
- Admin sees all (except other users' private notifications)

### Notification Linking
- All notifications include `linkedOrderId` (and `linkedReturnId` for returns)
- Tapping an order/return notification navigates directly to `/order/${linkedOrderId}`
- Return notifications shown in red styling
- All notifications auto-marked as read on page open

### Contact Info in Order Detail
- Contact card placed BELOW the editable/alternative products section
- Subtle muted text (11px, low opacity) — de-emphasized vs main action buttons
- Customer/pieces orders show sales phone (from settings contacts matching "مبيعات")
- Merchant orders show wholesale phone (matching "جملة" or "تاجر")

### Admin Users Page
- Search by name or phone number
- Sort by: date, name, order count
- Per-user stats: total orders, pending orders, total spent, last order date
- Inline confirmation dialog for role changes (customer ↔ merchant)
- VIP toggle, name editing, registration date display
- Staff tab: role switching (employee ↔ supervisor), permissions grid

### Pricing Logic
- Weight orders: price = weight × unit price (shown immediately); cart has +/- weight controls
- Piece orders: "Contact sales" message (no price shown)

## TypeScript & Composite Projects

Every package extends `tsconfig.base.json` which sets `composite: true`. The root `tsconfig.json` lists all packages as project references.
